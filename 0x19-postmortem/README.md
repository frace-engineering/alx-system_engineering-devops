----POSTMORTEM----

This project is about workdone report in network management.

After a service has been put off or detected to be malfunctioning through network monitor like datadog-agent, an alert is sent to a dev that is oncall for posible diagnosis and repair.

The report presented by the oncall dev staff, detailing the cause of the failure,
 the time the failure occured, the time he was alerted, the time it took hime to responde
 to the issue and the time taken to resolve the problem.

The report should also include steps taken to resolve the issue and possible system/network improvement to forstall
any future occurance of such failure due to the same problem.
